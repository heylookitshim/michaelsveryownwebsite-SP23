	<h1>Multimedia</h1>
	<h3> <span>This class touched on a few different types of art, with the most interesting to me being video. Before this class, I hadn't really used video editing software before. Although I don't really edit video much anymore, I still look back fondly on those assignments.
	My favorite project for this class involved me setting up a feild of pinwheels in my front yard and getting one of my neighbors to use a leafblower to move them!</span></h3>
