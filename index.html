			<h1>Michael Van Orman's Very Own One of a Kind Webpage!</h1>

				<h2>About Me!</h2>
			<h3><span>My name is Michael Van Orman, and I am currently studying art and design at Brightpoint Community College!<br> I have experience with both physical mediums such as paint and charcoal, as well as digital programs like Photoshop and Illustrator.<br>

			This site is a place for me to share the work that I'm most proud of from my time in academia so far.<br> If you so please, take a look around! I think there's some pretty neat stuff in here, at least.</span></h3>
