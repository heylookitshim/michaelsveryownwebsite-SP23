	<h1>2D Design</h1>
	<h3> <span>This class centered on using materials like construction paper and graphite,<br>but my favorite was paint!
	These projects were actually<br>my first time painting since high school; it definetly<br>took some getting used to. To be honest, I thought that<br>I wouldn't like painting that much, but I've grown to like it<br>so much that I still paint from time to time even today!</span></h3>
